# Case ID
#   this should be the ID of a family
test

# Sample ID (options: SAMPLE_ID, n [input 'n' if the corresponding sample does not exist]). 
# ALWAYS: patient/father/mother order.
#   this should be the sample IDs/prefices of each fastq file
#   trio example: test_patient/test_father/test_mother (if the Case ID is "test";
#       if the Case ID is "family314", and the sample IDs of the patient, father, and mother
#       are p, f, and m, respectively, you shoud write family314_p/family314_f/family314_m;
#       these sample IDs should be identical to the ones you write on your "id_CASE_ID.txt")
#   singleton example: test_patient/n/n
#   patient & father example: test_patient/test_father/n
#   patient & mother example: test_patient/n/test_mother
test_patient/test_father/test_mother

# Affected? (options: y, n). 
# ALWAYS: patient/father/mother order.
#   only the affected individual should be annotated 'y'
#   trio example (autosomal dominant case where the patient and the father is affected): y/y/n
#   trio example (de novo case where only the patient is affected): y/n/n
#   singleton example (only the patient is affected and sequenced): y/n/n
y/n/n

# Inheritance type (options: AD[autosomal dominant], AH[autosomal homozygous], 
#       XD[X-linked dominant], XH[X-linked homozygous], DN[de novo], 
#       AC[autosomal compound heterozygous], XC[X-linked compound heterozygous], 
#       YL[Y-linked], MT[mitochondrial])
# ALWAYS: separated by commas and only commas /,/ 
#   example: AH,DN,AC
#   example: AH
#   NOT an example: AD, XD
#   NOT an example: ;D (though it may look funny; not available at present)
#   list of inheritance types (or pedigree models) you want to analyze
#   when only the patient is affected --> possibly either AH, DN, and/or AC
#   then write: AH,DN,AC
AH

# MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) cutoff.
# ALWAYS: floating point number; can be 0 (most stringent), and separated by commas and only commas /,/
#   remove non-pathogenic variants with known MAF >= this cutoff
#   example: 0.005,1e-2
#   example: 5.0e-4
#   NOT an example: 
0,0.005,1e-2
